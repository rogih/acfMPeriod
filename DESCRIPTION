Description: This package presents the computation of the non-robust and robust sample autocovariance (ACOVF) and sample autocorrelation functions (ACF) of univariate and multivariate processes. The methodology consists in reversing the diagonalization procedure involving the periodogram or the cross-periodogram and the Fourier transform vectors, and, thus, obtaining the ACOVF or the ACF. The robust version is obtained fitting robust M-regressors to obtain the M-periodogram or M-cross-periodogram.
